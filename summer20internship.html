        introduction
      </h1>

      <p>in the spring semester of 2019, i was introduced to the blackstone through the blackstone future women innovators
        <a class="linkme" href="https://www.blackstone.com/careers/diversity-inclusion/">program</a>. through it, i visited
        and experienced the fast-paced life of nyc for the first time in over fifteen years, learned what blackstone innovations
        is all about, and had one of the best bowls of ramen <a class="linkme" href="https://www.seamless.com/menu/kuro-obi-ramen-urbanspace-570-lex-570-lexington-ave-new-york/1091338">here</a>.
        later in july of 2019, my mentor reached out to me to apply to the summer internship. fast-forward to september,
        i was walking out of my finance class when i got a call from blackstone telling me that i've received an offer!

      <p>
        <br> sooooo... what the heck is blackstone innovations? let's break it down into sections: </br>

        <br>blackstone itself is the world's largest private equity/alternative assets management and financial services firm. there's many teams that operate
        under the blackstone umbrella, and they've been involved in some pretty neat deals (see
				<a class="linkme" href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/oatly-gains-momentum-in-its-global-plant-based-movement-and-fuels-expansion-with-a-200-million-equity-investment-led-by-blackstone-growth/">oatly </a>
				& <a class='linkme' href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-to-acquire-ancestry-leading-online-family-history-business-for-4-7-billion/">ancestry</a>).
				if you're wondering what exactly private equity is, check out this <a class="linkme" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Vs9LPeHS0video">video</a>.
      </br>

        <br>blackstone innovations (now rebranded as blackstone technology and innovations) is the team that supports all the stuff going on behind the
        scenes. they're the people that brings efficiency within deal flow, and makes the lives of the deal teams and lps (limited partners) a lot easier,
        and innovations is constantly implementing new technologies that brings it to the front of industry competitors (looking at you, kkr, apollo, and
        goldman sachs!).
      </br>

        <br>there are many teams that reside within blackstone innovations, from engagement teams, to product teams. this summer, i was a product business analyst
        operating under the product management team, which focuses on products (applications) to be used by the deal flow teams. specifically, within the pm team,
        i worked with the ux team on its rebrand efforts, diving straight into three design sprints that challenged me as a creative and as a student.

          <h4><strong>this is my fantastic team!</strong></h4>

      <h1 id="project" class="section-title">
        project!
      </h1>
      <p>
        my task this summer was to completely redesign the original blackstone investor portal suite, which includes numerous applications within the portal. i worked with
        a team of two other interns, and with the guidance of our senior and junior mentors, we embarked on a series of three design sprints,
        and in the following three weeks, re-iterated and began our user testing sessions. our three sprints revolved around forms and inputs, grids and dashboards, and
        global components and card designs - i led the final sprint!

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> industry research </h3>

          this section comprises of in depth industry research, where my team pulled ui graphics from other designs found on behance and dribble, and observed competitor
          designs as well. from this, we would jump into lightning demos, finding industry competitors that we thought would be useful, then backing our research with
          compelling articles. we'd also participate in 'expert interviews,' with employees who were familiar with and had already worked on the portals, to get their
          understanding and feedback on what we could implement or improve on. then , we would complete a 'how might we' exercise, where my teammates and i would come
          up with the issues that we wanted to focus on throughout our design sprints. because of nda agreements, i can't fully go into what the project specs were -
          contact me if you'd like to know more!


        <h3 class="tabofcont"> analytics </h3>

          in this portion, my team and i used google analytics to pull data from current portal usage, mainly focusing on user behavior and events. because we wanted to minimize
          redundancy among our designs, we chose to hone in on user interactions (events such as number of clicks) and user time spent on site. from there, we would also pull data
          and analyze it through tableau.

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> design & iterations </h3>

          one of the most fun parts of the design sprint, yet simultaneously so frustrating. my team and i used adobe xd to mock up the sites and to simulate our new re-design. throughout
          the week, we would continue to tweak and improve on our designs, while following the rebrand guidelines that were already in place. at the end of the week, we would have a design
          review with the front end developers, and employees who currently work on the portal, to get their feedback. the user review sessions were so helpful, because through their feedback,
          we were able to vastly improve our designs. to prepare for the user testing session of our design project, my team and i worked diligently to prototype our designs so that they
          resembled that of a working portal, complete with hover features, clickable expandable cards, and folder implementation (and much, much more!).

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> user testing </h3>

          the user testing portion focused on grasping a user's interaction with our current designs. we conducted a/b testing, by testing users on the original brand investor portal, and then
          tested those same users on our re-design prototypes. in these user testing sessions, we randomly selected employees, and later, senior level execs (mds, the cto john stecher, the cto
          clientwide services rob wisniewski, and others!!!!) and guided them through timed tasks to see how quickly they'd be able to identify or navigate our prototypes. through this, we
          were able to more easily determine places where our prototypes fell short and how to continuously improve on them!
      </p>

      <h1 id="learning" class="section-title">
        my takeaways!
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br>it would be impossible to summarize everything i’ve learned - we'd be here all day long. i’ve picked up so many technical skills, from adobe xd, photoshop, to being able to navigate microsoft
        outlook and excel, and working on confluence/jira and lucidchart improved my overall office productivity. here was a huge learning curve for design thinking and adobe suite as I came in with
        no experience in digital design.
        </br>

        <br>coming in, i was quite shy and had a difficult time speaking up, especially in the remote setting. but through the supportive environment of this internship, i became more confident in
        speaking and presenting. i’ve learned project management skills from leading a design sprint from start to finish, sharpening my time management skills and understanding what needed to
        be done at a certain time. this was my first formal internship experience, so coming in, coffee chats were foreign to me, but through them, i was able to talk to so many incredible
        individuals who taught me so much, not just about blackstone and what it means to work here, but also offering valuable life advice. also, i’m from california, which meant that i
        woke up around 4 every morning to adjust to east coast time - so i’d say i definitely learned how to be a morning person.

      <h1 id="side" class="section-title">
        other cool stuff i got to work on!
      </h1>
      <p>
        <h3 class="tabofcont"> diversity and inclusion </h3>
          through bxti, i joined the diversity and inclusion committee - led by meiya chang and priya kankanhalli (inspiring people). i teamed up with another intern, rohan, and we wanted to
          uphold the 'colleague' and 'community' goals of the d&i committee. largely inspired by stanford's 'what i wish my professor knew' study, i wanted to implement a survey that would
          drive transparency in the workplace and foster conversations to help bxti develop a more inclusive, open space. i'm excited to see where this project goes - meiya and priya have
          mentioned that they are going to take this one step further and call it a campaign, where they'll also make a video having different employees read the anonymous responses.

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> pro-bono project </h3>
          my intern class was the first to implement these pro-bono projects. all the interns partipated in one of 10 projects, and i was on the start small think big: small business finance
          project. here, i helped the non-profit start small think big, an organization with the mission to support women/bipoc entrepreneurs and small businesses. through this, my team of six
          and i were able to push our recommendations on different institutional seeds, accelerators, and incubators to partner with and potentially recommend their clients to. our other
          recommendations revolved around how to manage budgetting and financing for these small businesses.

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> chummings! </h3>
          because this summer was all remote, it became <i>that </i>much more difficult to meet other interns. our solution? randomize and pair interns together weekly for an informal coffee chat.
          sri, another intern, and i worked together on this project. i focused on pairing students through randomizing them on excel, while she planned the themes per week. this was an incredible
          experience that allowed me to work more closely with the hr team, and meet so many incredible interns across different business groups.

      </h1>
      <p>
        <br>i could not have done it without  my incredible team of mentors. thanks to my senior and junior project mentors and managers, tiff and artina, your talent for design has inspired me to
        always think intuitively. to meiya and priya, my wonderful d&i mentors - your conviction for diversity and inclusion is something i hope to carry with me as i enter my final year of college.
        my intern mom and dad! dan and danielle, thank you for keeping us engaged and checking in with us, i know the bxti interns were pretty awkward in the beginning but you helped us break
        out of our shell. and to dan nolan, thank you for starting us off strong with the our trainings, and thank you for always checking up on us and planning all those amazing lunch and learns.
        </br>

        <br>to the dream team, divya and elly, thank you for keeping me in check. our daily zooms will be something that i miss in the upcoming school year.
        </br>

        <br>thank you to the entire intern class! it was great getting to know all the bxti interns, even though we couldn’t all meet in person, i felt very close to them. we always hopped on a call after
        work to play skribbl or codenames, and i appreciate those bonding moments we shared.
        </br>

        <br>thank you to the entirety of bxti for an incredible summer, you are all inspiring people that i’m honored to have worked with. i hope to meet all of these amazing people in person!
