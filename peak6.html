        to learn about my experience, my project, and everything i learned.

        introduction
      </h1>

      <p>i learned about peak6 in the fall semester of 2020 where a mutual friend had mentioned her work experience there.
        intrigued, i looked up the firm on the website and found the bootcamp - through the interview process, i learned more about the
        role, the people, and what peak6 was looking to do. i was so surprised to receive an offer, but i'm so glad i was part of this
        intensive, five day experience!
      </p>
      <h1 id="overview" class="section-title">
        quick overview
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br> sooooo... what is peak6?</br>

        <br> peak6 prides itself in being in the business of 'what ought to be' - they're good with breaking down structures that don't work, and rebuilding models in an
        innovative, unique way. peak6 is a financial services firm offering trading, investment, clearing, and execution solutions - especially in debts and equity. with their aquisition
        of <a class="linkme" href="https://www.apexclearing.com/" target="_blank"> apex clearing</a>, they've placed themselves at the forefront of clearing trades, and continue to acquire and invest
        in companies such as <a class="linkme" href="https://evilgeniuses.gg/" target="_blank"> evil geniuses</a>.
      </br>

        <br>the business operator bootcamp usually operates in chicago (i said this a lot, but summers in chicago are absolutely gorgeous). it's a week long program dedicated to catching
        you up on the strategic capital function of peak6, where bootcampers spend a week solving a <a class="linkme" href='assets/POKER POWHER Case Study.pdf' target="_blank">case</a> for
        <a class="linkme" href="https://www.pokerpowher.com/" target="_blank"> poker powher</a>. poker powher is an organization who's intent is to empower women by teaching them how to play poker. poker
        powher believes that poker will help women gain the skills necessary to become successful in any industry, particularly in the financial services, by instilling confidence skills,
        risk management, and capital allocation.

      <h1 id="project" class="section-title">
        project!
      </h1>
      <p>
        my team of five's task this bootcamp was to take apart the current poker powher business model and completely revamp it. with the guidance of our four mentors, who
        were previous bootcamp attendees, we went through a full week of brainstorming, incorporating the early stages of a design sprint system and coming up with a solution that
        did not coincide with a provided <a class="linkme" href="assets/No Go List.pdf" target="_blank"> no-go</a> list.

        <h3 class="tabofcont"> our final presentation </h3>

          we have two propositions to help poker powher reach its goal of having one million women around the world play poker. because of the negative stigma surrounding poker, from:
          <ol>
            <li>traditionally a male dominated sport </li>
            <li>intimidating and aggressive</li>
            <li>association with gambling</li>
          </ol>
          we wanted to address by encouraging women to play women, not by brute forcing their participation. by changing the perception, we thought that we could market this idea as
          an inclusive, welcoming space for people of all genders. we tackled the issue from two sides: creating an inuitive and sleek app, and gaining corporate partnerships to
          increase traffic.

      <h1 id="learning" class="section-title">
        my takeaways!
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br>it was incredibly difficult to come up with a solution that wasn't already on the no-go list. and it's incredibly difficult to get up at 6am everyday to adjust to central time. after my
        summer internship at blackstone ended, i didn't take the time to rest and jumped straight into the bootcamp. but i really enjoyed getting to learn more about peak6 and meet
        <a class="linkme" href='assets/speakerp6.pdf' target="_blank">these</a> incredible people. i learned so much about the company culture, how people here don't settle for a status quo - they
        go out and make their own path. it's so evident to see how innovative and forward thinking these people are. i got to continue improving my xd skills and i learned more about excel modeling
        through my team's revenue projections.

        acknowledgements
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br>i want to thank peak6 and the incredible team of mentors who worked tirelessly to provide this experience for us. they had been operating this bootcamp on top of their daily work, and
        i cannot imagine how difficult that must have been.
